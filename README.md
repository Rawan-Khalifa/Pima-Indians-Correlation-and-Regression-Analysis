# Pima-Indians-Correlation-and-Regression-Analysis


This report aims to investigate the association between hyperglycemia (high blood glucose)1 and hypertension (high systolic or diastolic blood pressure) in the Pima Indian population. 

Iâ€™m particularly aiming to construct a regression model to predict diastolic blood pressure based on plasma glucose concentration.

Here is the full documentation of the project along with the analysis and conclusions:
